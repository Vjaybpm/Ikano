#An optics to convert
# - name
# - address
# - phones

# Imagine we have three variables: name/phones/address
title: ${name.title}
firstName: ${name.firstName}
lastName: ${name.lastName}
name: ${join.. ' ', name.firstName, name.lastName} # Note that this is not perfectly bidirectional. But it's not bad
address: ${join.. ' ', address.street, address.houseNumber, address.city, address.canton, address.postalCode, address.zipCode, address.country}

# So instead of this being a 'get me the data' this can be 'get me a function'. We have getters and setters. Most will be codec. Some just setters

#This is very declarative. Some functions allow you to be a lens. Others are only 'getters' (perhaps there are only setter functions too)

# Say we are calling equifax_creditCheck. We have a list of lens that we need, and declaratively we can use them for the output.
# If some lens are composite that's OK, we can can back to the list they need too... and make the big list
